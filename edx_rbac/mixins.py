    Mixin for checking role-based access against multiple objects, specifically
    using the "list" action of a DRF ViewSet.  The brunt of the work is done in
    the `accessible_contexts` cached property - this property determines the set
    of "contexts" (probably identifiers of some model) to which the requesting
    user has access under any of the `allowed_roles`.  It's pretty opinionated and
    you _must_ define the following fields:

    `list_lookup_field` (string) - The field of the model you want to list instances of
    that holds values defined by `accessible_contexts`.

    `allowed_roles` (list) - A list of one or more roles against which access is checked.  It's disjunctive,
    which means that if "role_1" grants access to resources "A" and "B", and
    "role_2" grants access to resource "C", defining `allowed_roles = ['role_1', 'role_2']`
    will cause resources "A", "B", and "C" to be returned by a listing operation
    for a user who is granted both "role_1" and "role_2".

    `role_assignment_class` (class) - The RoleAssignmentClass against which DB-defined access is checked.

    `base_queryset` (property) - A queryset which acts as the "base case".  It should generally return
    all accessible instances for a user who has access to anything within this viewset (like a superuser
    or admin).
